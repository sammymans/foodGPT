# foodGPT :poultry_leg:

foodGPT is a product that aims to incorporate machine learning to optimize one's cooking experience and reducing the amount of food waste. A minority of 37% of university cook regularly - the other portion seldom cook or never cook. Additionally, those who cook approximately waste 50% of ingredients for several reasons: 

- low cooking confidence
- purchased too many groceries for the week
- unsure of what to do with excess ingredients

foodGPT has three main components: computer vision, ingredient substitution, and recipe recommendation. Computer Vision is yet to be implemented, however the other two components can be found in code.

This project was built using [This Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/shuyangli94/food-com-recipes-and-user-interactions).
