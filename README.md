# foodGPT :poultry_leg:

foodGPT is a product that aims to incorporate machine learning to optimize one's cooking experience and reducing the amount of food waste. A minority of 37% of university cook regularly - the other portion seldom cook or never cook. Additionally, those who cook approximately waste 50% of ingredients, making up 37% of their income. This issues arise for several reasons: 

- low cooking confidence
- purchased too many groceries for the week
- unsure of what to do with excess ingredients

foodGPT has three main components: computer vision, ingredient substitution, and recipe recommendation. Computer Vision is yet to be implemented, however the other two components can be found in code.

This project was built using [This Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/shuyangli94/food-com-recipes-and-user-interactions).

## How it Works

## Smart Substitution Model

## Matrix Factorization Recommendation Model

## Combined Model

## Discussion

## Future Considerations

One objective to pursue is to implement computer vision to allow users to easily load in their 'shelf' or 'fridge' data into the application. The idea is to use computer vision to take a picture of a receipt, tokenize the groceries, and add this list of available ingredients to the application to being accurately reccomending recipes.

Additionally, instead of a recommendation approach to suggesting recipes to users, a generative recipe approach could be researched. This way, our product could become more flexible to user's available ingredients, thus further reducing food waste.
